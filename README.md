# Scope AR Job Application

This is my submission for the Scope AR programming test. I've created this with C# in the .NET Core 2.0 I believe I've gone past what may have been originally intended for scope of this assignment. This was done to better demonstrate how I thought this problems should be solved if it were to be integrated into other code. I've made each solution to the two problems into their own classes. Furthermore I've added a factory for the creation of each solution. The actual solution of each problem is called in the creator of each class so that each can be drawn multiple time without the need to recalculate each shape. 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Test were created with Visual Studio default testing library. You should be able to run them through the test explorer or, with "ctrl + R, A"

I've created tests for just the ConsoleShape namespace. This was because I was working under the assumtion that you wanted me to create those solutions as example code in a larger project and that the user input section was less important. 


## Deployment
